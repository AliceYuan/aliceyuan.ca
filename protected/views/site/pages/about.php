Hello! The @Names_Alice and I'm a student studying at the University of Waterloo pursuing an undergraduate degree in software engineering. I'm still a newbie when it comes to the world of programming but watch out, I learn fast. I'm passionate about development, especially in creating functional and aesthetic applications with great user experience.

<br>
<br>
I have done both back end and front end development and I also have experimented with design in my spare time. You could say that I aspire to be a jack of all trades. I interned as a web developer at Myplanet Digital this past summer and had the privilege of attending the computer science summer program at Google the summer prior.

<br>
<br>
I also like to read, draw, take photographs and go on adventures.

<br>

Want to talk? I'm always up for a chat!
