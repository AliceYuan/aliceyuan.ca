      <span class="hello">Hello!</span> The <a href="//twitter.com/Names_Alice"><span class="ss-twitter"></span>Names_Alice</a> and I'm a student studying at the University of Waterloo pursuing an undergraduate degree in Software Engineering. I am passionate about writing beautiful code that create applications with aesthetic and functional interfaces.

      Call me young, but I'm not ill-experienced. I have interned as a web developer at  <a href="//myplanetdigital.com" class="mpd">Myplanet Digital</a> this past summer (2012) and have had the privilege of attending the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2011/08/fast-tracking-young-web-developers-at.html?"> Computer Science Summer Institute at Google </a>  the summer prior (2011).

      I have experience with both back-end and front-end development and have also experimented with web design in my spare time. I'm still at that “self-discovery phase” and I love that I'm learning new things everyday.</p>
